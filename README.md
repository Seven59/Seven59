So i recently became a linux user. 
Yea its all over with now people. ive gone to to dev side! 
jokes! i actually just became a computer user as well. (not jokes!)
ive had the best time of my life doing whatever doors Linux opens my way. its only been 5 months anf surprisingly i am still determined to become not just good but great and t what im bot sure. i guess ive learned more towards security side but whete does that leave me in a career choice. Frankly Zero. ill just have to keep searching for my niche. so for now, my you shoot for the stars and land @ source.
