What's up computer people. Are you havin fun yet? I sure am!
I'm currently in the process of building a custom OS. 
I run a Linux kernal on Fedora as the current OS. 
Nothing wrong with it just not interested in the direction that REHL seems to be going in.
I like Security. I also like my privacy. And I respect the privacy of others. 
I've run all that matters in the Linux Distrobution Cirlce. They're all the same at the end of the day.
My prefered Distro is Debian on a XFCE DE. Keep it light, keep it fast, keep it movin.
For me running a Kali, Parro, or a Backbox isnt optimal to me. They're pre-packeged bloatware.
I'm eager to learn but have a bigger interest in understanding how things work before jumping head first into a field with 20 year vets.
I've only just begun but already i come across a few people who are in school or have started a Cyber Security llc. who seem to just not have a clue or are completly wrong in regards to the topic.
Seeing those few have given me a confidence in my future success. Them being in School or starting a business implies that they would have a knowledge in computers right? Well I don't.
I've only owned a computer since December 2023, and haven't been on one since i was 16. I'm 33. I took half a pyhton course and took off like a rocket. Havent slowed down yet. Dont plan on it either. 
I'm lovin it like MickeyD's. i find interest in some of the subjects everyone else say are boring. I'm like yea right! This is Cool!
