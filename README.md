[Whats up computer people! My names Seven.
I'm kinda new to this world. But im a fast learner when determined.
I'm 33 y/o. Currently divorced, unemployed and even more recent a broken wrist w/ cast.
Perfect for learning something useful and occupying my time instead of following the world news and "conspiracy theories".
Call it what you want, but i've come a long way since Dec, 2023. (thats when i finally got a computer.)
So yeah im new to all this. But even im impressed/surprised with how far ive come.
My other GitHub is under DroMeta. Thats where i started and i still maintain it.
I only wanted to learn how to code but the world of Computing is a rabbit hole, and i love a good rabbit hole!
Havent stopped yet. I cant, and i dont want to anyway. Grew up playing video games and i havent touched a controller since i touched the keyboard.
If you ask me what i want the end result to be, i guess id say something that makes money. 
And only because its a neccesity. I hate money! Its an evil some people cant handle. 
I only say that because if this doesnt turn a profit somehow im going to have to focus my time elsewhere. And i really like this stuff.
I've been to college twice. Both for the wrong things or reasons. 
I fell in love with my Terminal and Linux. i just crunk up OpenSUSE. Moved from Fedora and before that was Debian. ALOT of Debians!
It feels like forever ago that i started this journey but alas it has not been even a years passing.
I went from knowing nothing about computers to running almost everything through the terminal. i still feel like i dont know anything, maybe i dont but i can
read scipt and understand it {for the most part}. i can build custom Debian iso's. i turned Fedora into a cursed Kali remix. i brought 2 labtops back from what i thoght was a wrap. 
{One of them being my moms which was hit with a preloaded malware script that filled its memory with an endless barrage of files while deleting everything else. 
{i also fixed it without replacing any hardware.}} I also tricked my internet into beleiving its stronger then it actually is. {Literally crap!} 
i built a Fileshare EC2 instance. thats just what i can remeber off the top of my head.
I love this stuff! im an old dog in a world of puppies and vets though and i feel like i have alot of catching up to do. 
All profesional advice ive come accross suggests im doing it wrong, but i feel acomplished in my short time with it all. 
Currently 4 1/2 months. Before that i hadnt touched a computer since i was 16. im just letting the computer lead the way to what comes next.
Cheers to all! ive gotta do something else besides this lol
